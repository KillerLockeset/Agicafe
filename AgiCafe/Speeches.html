      people express their opinion without fear, but how far can the opinion be expressed?<br>
      We know that after a certain point, freedom of expression becomes discourse of<br>
      hate, but this time, we'll focus more on hate speech. What is its etymology?<br>
      What does the law say about this? That's what our dear guest Roberto Menezes is about<br>

      social networks emerged. But with the amount of people who use them today<br>
      nowadays there has been a huge diversity of opinions, and for one to come into conflict with the<br>
      another just a few clicks. And that's why we live in an era where people try to shut up some<br>
      to others because of their opinions, that's where freedom of expression applies in the digital world.<br>
      But is free speech on the internet different from free speech in the real world?<br>
      And how exactly does it apply in the real world? It's about that and a few more things that our<br>

      of those who patiently listen to opinions opposite to their own.” So intolerance would be something<br>
      opposite to that, that is, not listening patiently<br>
      opinions different from yours, but what effects does intolerance have on our society?<br>
      When did intolerance appear and what were the biggest examples? It's about these things that our<br>

      this method is called cancellation, it was elected the term of the year in 2019 by the<br>
      Macquarie dictionary and is used to this day. This method consists of nothing else nothing<br>
      less than boycotting a person's account if they express a considered opinion.<br>
      reprehensible, but is this method any good? Is it effective? We will analyze the cases of<br>
      cancellation of non-celebrities that have taken on unnecessary proportions and we will take our<br>

      and when it is misinterpreted, it can lead to bad actions and end up<br>
      causing problems, the main example of this is hate speech,<br>
      which is a mistaken view of freedom of expression. Our Guest Carlos Beni<br>
